# 👋 Hi, I'm Yagnik Fadadu

I'm a passionate developer and a recent graduate in Information Technology Engineering. My interests lie at the intersection of software development, artificial intelligence (Computer Vision & L.A.), and building systems that improve everyday life.

This GitHub profile is a curated showcase of some of the projects I’ve built during my academic journey and beyond. I have many unreleased works that are *dying* to be uploaded—stay tuned, I’ll keep updating this space soon!
